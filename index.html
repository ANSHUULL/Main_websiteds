        <h1>Introduction of Data Structures</h1>
        <div id="maincontent">
            <p>
                A data structure is a particular way of organising data in a computer so that it can be used
                effectively. The idea is to reduce the space and time complexities of different tasks.


                The choice of a good data structure makes it possible to perform a variety of critical operations
                effectively. An efficient data structure also uses minimum memory space and execution time to process
                the structure. A data structure is not only used for organising the data. It is also used for
                processing, retrieving, and storing data. There are different basic and advanced types of data
                structures that are used in almost every program or software system that has been developed. So we must
                have good knowledge of data structures.

            <h2>Need of Data Structure</h2>
            The structure of the data and the synthesis of the algorithm are relative to each other. Data presentation
            must be easy to understand so the developer, as well as the user, can make an efficient implementation of
            the operation.
            Data structures provide an easy way of organising, retrieving, managing, and storing data.

            Here is a list of the needs for data.<br>
            1) Data structure modification is easy.<br>
            2) It requires less time.<br>
            3)Save storage memory space.<br>
            4) Data representation is easy.<br>
            5) Easy access to the large database.<br>

            <h3>Classification/Types of Data Structures:</h3>
            1) Linear Data Structure<br>
            2) Non-Linear Data Structure.<br>
            i) Linear Data Structure:<br>
            Elements are arranged in one dimension ,also known as linear dimension.<br>
            Example: lists, stack, queue, etc.<br>
            ii) Non-Linear Data Structure<br>
            Elements are arranged in one-many, many-one and many-many dimensions.<br>
            Example: tree, graph, table, etc.
